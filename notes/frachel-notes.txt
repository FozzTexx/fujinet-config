Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface), 
so why not make that common.. then at the individual system folder level each screen.c would include "../screen.h", 
and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

nc->ssid and ac->ssid are out of sync.. look into which is right to use.


TO DO (estimate 90-95% done at this point):

    Replace mount_and_boot() code with single call to command $D7 : https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/fujinet-platformio/wiki/SIO-Command-%24D7-Mount-All
    
    Clean up navigation while selecting files. Check against original config to make sure same keys are all implemented.
    
    Selecting mode (r/w) on a new disk creation isn't working.

    implement changing disk mode (r/w) while in input_hosts_and_devices_devices();

    implement screen_select_file_display_long_filename()
    
    implement screen_select_file_clear_long_filename()

    general cleanup, add comments, etc.
