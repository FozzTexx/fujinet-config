Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface), 
so why not make that common.. then at the individual system folder level each screen.c would include "../screen.h", 
and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

nc->ssid and ac->ssid are out of sync.. look into which is right to use.


TO DO (estimate 90-95% done at this point):

    From mozzwald testing:
        last thing I noticed, theres an option to configure wifi as disabled in fnconfig.ini. if wifi is disabled, config should skip the scan and not allow entry to a tnfs server.

  
    Selecting mode (r/w) on a new disk creation isn't working.

    implement screen_select_file_display_long_filename()
        exammple: fujinet.online, holmes cd1, atari, games, games_a, adventure 03.
    implement screen_select_file_clear_long_filename()

    general cleanup, add comments, etc.
