Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface),

and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

Questions:
    io_get_device_enabled_status() - Don't see this for SIO, should it return true or false?

        or should they be blanked out first?
