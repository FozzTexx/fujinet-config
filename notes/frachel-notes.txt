When jumping between hosts and devices with tab key, it remembers where you were and puts you there. check if that was the same in other config.

maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same func defs in screen.h (its like an interface), so why not make that common. 
then at the systemfolder level, each screen.c would include "../screen.h", and then their own, say "screen_atari.h" with functions just for them.

nc->ssid and ac->ssid are out of sync. why do we have both?
