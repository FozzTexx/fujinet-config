Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface), 
so why not make that common.. then at the individual system folder level each screen.c would include "../screen.h", 
and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

nc->ssid and ac->ssid are out of sync.. look into which is right to use.


TO DO (estimate 90-95% done at this point):

    From mozzwald testing:
        left from root dir in a host, go back to host/slots
        ok,  for joystick, up, down and fire work. left should go back/up a dir when browsing
        < (0x1C) and > (0x1D) shoudl go prev/next page
  
    Clean up navigation while selecting files. Check against original config to make sure same keys are all implemented.
    
    Selecting mode (r/w) on a new disk creation isn't working.

    implement screen_select_file_display_long_filename()
        exammple: fujinet.online, holmes cd1, atari, games, games_a, adventure 03.
    implement screen_select_file_clear_long_filename()

    general cleanup, add comments, etc.
