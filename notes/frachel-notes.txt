Maybe have common .h files at the top-level? For example, everyone has to have the same function definitions in screen.h (its like an interface), 
so why not make that common.. then at the individual system folder level each screen.c would include "../screen.h", 
and then their own (if necessary), such as "screen_atari.h" with functions only they need.

nc->ssid and ac->ssid are out of sync.. look into which is right to use.

Questions:
    io_get_device_enabled_status() - Don't see this for SIO, should it return true or false?


TO DO:
    Clean up navigation selecting files. Check against original config.
    
    Selecting mode (r/w) on a new disk creation isn't working.

    implement changing disk mode while in input_hosts_and_devices_devices();

    implement screen_select_file_display_long_filename()
    
    implement screen_select_file_clear_long_filename()

    custom sized new file screens/input/io
